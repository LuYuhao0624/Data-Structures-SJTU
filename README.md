# Data-Structures-SJTU
This repository contains data structures exercises from both ACM [OJ](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/OnlineJudge/problems) and Beihang University [OJ](http://course.educg.net). Problems in ACM OJ are much more difficult.  
Those with numbers are from ACM OJ. You can go and check the task descriptions. For those from Beihang OJ, task descriptions are inside the folder.
